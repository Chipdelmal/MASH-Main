summary: "DHM-Basic is an approximating model to the complete DHM model, which includes spatial heterogeneity, as well as explicit simulation of humans, pathogens, and all mosquito activity. DHM-Basic is a generic term to refer to abstractions of this model. Abstractions come from realizing that the life-course of any individual mosquito can be thought of as a continuous time Markov process with a finite state space."
