summary: "The repository is divided into branches for development although the main ones are 'MASH' for the general programming process and 'gh-pages' for the documentation."

GitHub is the code hosting platform being used by MASH development to facilitate collaboration and to implement version control. GitHub keeps multiple versions of the code (i.e. a "branch") in the cloud. Users can clone the code on their own device. A useful program for doing this is called GitHub Desktop. 

When any user makes changes to their cloned local text, these can be saved back and update the cloud. The convention here is for developers to create their own branch, and then to reconcile different versions of the code in the "default branch" using something called a "pull request." 

GitHub saves old versions of the code; if something is accidentally deleted, it can be recovered from an older, working version. That is enough of a local introduction.  For more information about GitHub, start here:  <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Hello GitHub!</a>
