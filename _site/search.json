Each riskList stores information from a human Activity.Space algorithm and is used by a corresponding chooseHost function. These are called only by MICRO as location is resolved only to the patch level in MACRO."

"keywords": "",

"summary": "The Aquatic Ecology routines govern how mosquitoes emerge from aquatic habitats/laying sites. There are two main modules provided: EL4P and Emerge. EL4P is a detailed model that incorporates mating and oviposition into aquatic habitats and simulates the maturation of egg batches through the larval and pupal stages to emergence. Emerge is a simplified model of mosquito emergence that takes into account seasonality and stochastic variation in productivity of aquatic habitats but does not simulate the larval or pupal stages of mosquito development."

"summary": "DHM-Basic is an approximating model to the complete DHM model, which includes spatial heterogeneity, as well as explicit simulation of humans, pathogens, and all mosquito activity. DHM-Basic is a generic term to refer to abstractions of this model. Abstractions come from realizing that the life-course of any individual mosquito can be thought of as a continuous time Markov process with a finite state space."
